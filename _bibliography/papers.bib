  title={Cross-Coupled Dynamics and MPA-Optimized Robust MIMO Control for a Compact Unmanned Underwater Vehicle},
  author={Tanveer, A. and Ahmad, S.},
  abstract={A compact, 3-degrees-of-freedom (DoF), low-cost, remotely operated unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV), or MicroROV, is custom-designed, developed, instrumented, and interfaced with a PC for real-time data acquisition and control. The nonlinear equations of motion (EoM) are developed for the under-actuated, open-frame, cross-coupled MicroROV utilizing the Newton-Euler approach. The cross-coupling between heave and yaw motion, an important dynamic of a class of compact ROVs that is barely reported, is investigated here. This work is thus motivated towards developing an understanding of the physics of the highly coupled compact ROV and towards developing model-based stabilizing controllers. The linearized EoM aids in developing high-fidelity experimental data-driven transfer function models. The coupled heave-yaw transfer function model is improved to an auto-regressive moving average with exogenous input (ARMAX) model structure. The acquired models facilitate the use of the multi-parameter root-locus (MPRL) technique to design baseline controllers for a cross-coupled multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) MicroROV. The controller gains are further optimized by employing an innovative Marine Predator Algorithm (MPA). The robustness of the designed controllers is gauged using gain and phase margins. In addition, the real-time controllers were deployed on an onboard embedded system utilizing Simulink's automatic C++ code generation capabilities. Finally, pool tests of the MicroROV demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control strategy.},

  title={Design and Testing of a Compact Inexpensive Prototype Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicle for Shallow Water Operation},
  author={Tanveer, A. and Ahmad, S.},
  abstract={This article introduces the development of an unmanned remotely operated vehicle (ROV) that measures 35 cm x 26 cm x 23 cm and weighs 1.59 kg. The primary objective is to remotely communicate in real time using serial protocol to record the vehicle's orientation data. The three DC motors powering the ROV are controlled by a multi-parameter root-locus proportional integral (MRPL-PI) controller. Utilizing the processing capabilities of the Atmega328 microcontroller, heading, depth control, and water condition monitoring are all accomplished simultaneously. The Arduino development environment is used to establish the ROV's remote control. The problem with human divers who can only descend to a depth of 30 meters is resolved by the proposed ROV's ability to dive up to 100 meters underwater. Furthermore, the suggested vehicle can be beneficial in marine applications such as measurement, maintenance, operations, and surveillance.},
